                    <p>Think laid-back, pick-up truck and boot-scooting town meets high-powered, high-cultured and high-heeled metropolis. During the day, chill out in your flip-flops, take in museums and go shopping, then hit happy hour on a leaf-shaded deck. At night, revel in culinary or cultural bliss – the restaurant and entertainment scenes are renowned across the region. Here, starched jeans are de rigueur in all but the very fanciest of restaurants.</p>
