                    <p>San Antonio's selling point these days? Tourists might say they've come for the Alamo and the River Walk. But locals are touting the city's easy diversity, with all races and cultures truly coexisting and supporting each other. Residents are also excited about the ever-growing Pearl District – it may seem like half the city is here on a sunny Saturday afternoon. And we've never seen a place with so many bicycle-share stations, making it easy to explore the Museum Reach and the Mission Reach (the newest sections of the famed River Walk).</p>

                    <p>San Antonio (/ˌsæn ænˈtoʊnioʊ/ Spanish for "Saint Anthony"), officially the City of San Antonio, is the seventh most populous city in the United States and the second most populous city in both Texas and the Southern United States.[5] Founded as a Spanish mission and colonial outpost in 1718, the city became the first chartered civil settlement in Texas in 1731, making it the state's oldest municipality.[6][7] The city's deep history is contrasted with its rapid growth: it was the fastest-growing of the top ten largest cities in the United States from 2000 to 2010, and the second from 1990 to 2000.[8][9] Straddling the regional divide between South and Central Texas, San Antonio anchors the southwestern corner of an urban megaregion colloquially known as the "Texas Triangle".</p>
